git-credential-store(1)
=======================

NAME
----
git-credential-store - Helper to store credentials on disk

SYNOPSIS
--------
-------------------
git config credential.helper 'store [options]'
-------------------

DESCRIPTION
-----------

NOTE: Using this helper will store your passwords unencrypted on disk,
protected only by filesystem permissions. If this is not an acceptable
security tradeoff, try linkgit:git-credential-cache[1], or find a helper
that integrates with secure storage provided by your operating system.

This command stores credentials indefinitely on disk for use by future
Git programs.

You probably don't want to invoke this command directly; it is meant to
be used as a credential helper by other parts of git. See
linkgit:gitcredentials[7] or `EXAMPLES` below.

OPTIONS
-------

--store=<path>::

	Use `<path>` to store credentials. The file will have its
	filesystem permissions set to prevent other users on the system
	from reading it, but will not be encrypted or otherwise
	protected. Defaults to `~/.git-credentials`.

EXAMPLES
--------

The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you must type
your username or password. For example:

------------------------------------------
$ git config credential.helper store
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
Username: <type your username>
Password: <type your password>

[several days later]
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
[your credentials are used automatically]
------------------------------------------

STORAGE FORMAT
--------------

The `.git-credentials` file is stored in plaintext. Each credential is
stored on its own line as a URL like:

------------------------------
https://user:pass@example.com
------------------------------

When Git needs authentication for a particular URL context,
credential-store will consider that context a pattern to match against
each entry in the credentials file.  If the protocol, hostname, and
username (if we already have one) match, then the password is returned
to Git. See the discussion of configuration in linkgit:gitcredentials[7]
for more information.
